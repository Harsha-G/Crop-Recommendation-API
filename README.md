# Crop-Recommender-API

This project is an extension of the Crop Recommender I made here: https://github.com/Harsha-G/Crop-Recommendation-using-Machine-Learning

In this project I deploy the artifacts I created from the Crop Recommendation Project, which are the Truncated SVD model and the KNN-Classfier. Using the Django RestFramework I can then make requests to these artifacts and be able to properly return the crop that is recommended.

To run the server, navigate to the 'CropRecommenderAPI' directory and type: 
**python manage.py runserver**

A demo example which is also found in the attached notebook:
